# python-monorepo-test

An attempted Python monorepo with interdependent packages.

In order to have both packages installed in editable mode,
you need to do `pip install -e .` for `monorepo` first, and _then_ do it for `monorepo-core`.
Installing `monorepo` will install `monorepo` in editable mode,
but `monorepo-core` will be installed in regular mode,
so you need to reinstall it in editable mode.

## monorepo_core

The core package, containing only the key elements of the package.

# monorepo

The expanded package, which uses monorepo_core as a dependency.
